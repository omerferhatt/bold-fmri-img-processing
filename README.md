# Image processing on BOLD fMRI data

Blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) is the most common
method for measuring human brain activity non-invasively in-vivo. BOLD fMRI images are 4-dimensional, consisting of a
time series of 3d volumes, acquired in quick succession (every 1 or 2 seconds) typically over a period of 8-15 minutes


##### Task
We will work with the `Multisubject - Multimodal Face Processing Dataset` available at openneuro.org.
* Link: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/versions/1.0.3

This dataset involves presentation of images of faces to the subject while acquiring BOLD fMRI images of the subjectâ€™s
brain activity. Your job is to preprocess these scans and then, in python, localize the brain area that processes faces.

## How to use
Project has a couple of different workflow in it.

* Folder manipulation
* Pre-processing
* Localizing
* Visualizing

---

##### Pre-processing usage
* `python3 main.py --pre-process`
    * Only pre-processing

* `python3 main.py --pre-process --localize`
    * Pre-processing after localization
    
* `python3 main.py --select-data patient01 patient02 --pre-process localize`
    * Pre-processing and localization on only specified datas
    
##### Using previous pre-processed data
* `python3 main.py --use-pre ...`
    * Use `--use-pre` instead of `--pre-process to get avoid long process time
    
##### Localizing
* Localizing raw data
    * `python3 main.py --localize`

* Localizing processed data
    * `python3 main.py --use-pre --localize`
    
##### Visualizing correlations
* Can visualize one dataset only
    * `python3 main.py --select-data patient01 --use-pre --visualize-corr`

##### Batch Processing
* Only works with processed data
    * `python3 main.py --use-pre --localize --batch-process`
---
#### Arguments

* Console input:

`python3 main.py --help`

--- 
`-h, --help`
* Shows help message

`-p, --pre-process`
* Pre-process whole data in raw directory.
May take several hours according to the computer. 
Use the `--select-data` parameter to pre-process only the desired data
                    
`-u, --use-pre`
* When the flag is activated, uses pre-processed data to localize faces.
                    
`-l, --localize`
* Applies localize task activation to the MRI input

`--pipeline PIPELINE`
* Specifies the path to the bash code that will create the pipeline, leave it as default to work normally.
                    
`-S SELECT_DATA [SELECT_DATA ...], --select-data SELECT_DATA [SELECT_DATA ...]`
* Select data, otherwise all of them going to be used.
                    
`--data-folder` DATA_FOLDER
* Specifies the path to the folder containing the raw data.
                    
`--pre-data-folder` PRE_DATA_FOLDER
* Specifies the path to the folder where the processed data is located or to be saved after pre-processing.

`-b, --batch_process`
* Applies linear alignment and registration with correlation into T1 image.

`-v, --visualize-corr`
* Visualize different between processed and unprocessed data corr. Needs to be used with `--use-pre`
                    
`-i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE`
* Specifies the input MRI image file name

`-o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE`
* Specifies the output MRI image file name

`-e EVENT_FILE, --event-file EVENT_FILE`
* Specifies the events file name

`-H HRF_FILE, --hrf-file HRF_FILE`
* Specifies the HRF file name

`-t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE`
* Specifies the path to template T1 space, leave it as default to work normally.
