# Image processing on BOLD fMRI data

Blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) is the most common
method for measuring human brain activity non-invasively in-vivo. BOLD fMRI images are 4-dimensional, consisting of a
time series of 3d volumes, acquired in quick succession (every 1 or 2 seconds) typically over a period of 8-15 minutes


##### Task
We will work with the `Multisubject - Multimodal Face Processing Dataset` available at openneuro.org.
* Link: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/versions/1.0.3

This dataset involves presentation of images of faces to the subject while acquiring BOLD fMRI images of the subjectâ€™s
brain activity. Your job is to preprocess these scans and then, in python, localize the brain area that processes faces.
